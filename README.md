# MixBreak

MixBreak is a basic program that allows you to automate the playing of ADs during your Mixer Stream.

## Installation

Head over to the [Releases Tab](https://github.com/NickParks/MixBreak/releases) and download the latest `MixBreak.exe` version!

## Usage
When you first open the program, it will run a "first run" setup where you enter how often you want to run ads. Please note Mixer has a hard set rule that one AD can only be run every 15 minutes. We will automatically set this if you choose a value below that.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
